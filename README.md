## Project Overview
Hospitals often experience delays in emergency patient care due to poor visibility of available beds across wards. 
This project implements a PL/SQL-based Emergency Response and Bed Availability Tracker that automates bed allocation, prevents double booking, and provides real-time availability and auditing.

## Problem Statement
Manual tracking of hospital bed availability causes delays in emergency response and increases the risk to patients. 
There is a need for an automated, reliable, and auditable database system to manage admissions efficiently.

## Key Objectives
- Track ward and bed availability in real time
- Prioritize emergency patients automatically
- Prevent invalid admissions and double booking
- Enforce business rules using triggers
- Maintain a full audit trail of database activities
- Support analytics and decision-making

## Technologies Used
- Oracle Database 21c XE
- PL/SQL
- SQL Developer
- GitHub

## Quick Start
1. Run scripts in `database/scripts/` in order
2. Connect using schema `PDB_ADMIN`
3. Execute sample queries in `queries/`
4. Review audit results and BI documentation
